# Plot-orbit-of-two-body-using-rk4
This program simulates the orbit of an orbiting mass around a central mass (e.g., a satellite orbiting the Earth) using the Runge-Kutta 4th Order numerical method. The initial conditions of the satellite are set for a geostationary orbit. The satellite's initial position is 35,786 kilometers above the Earth's surface, and its initial velocity is 3.07 kilometers per second, resulting in a circular orbit. Modifying the initial speed slightly changes the orbit's eccentricity, making it more elliptical as the value deviates from 3.07 km/s.

The period of the simulation can be adjusted, but it is currently set for one day, which corresponds to the approximate time a geostationary satellite takes to complete a single orbit. The entire animation is rendered using the tkinter module, with customizable options such as color, canvas dimensions, and additional graphical features like tracer and radial lines.
